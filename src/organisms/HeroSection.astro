        Well, I guess the best way to know me is to check out my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@f-techenglish295" class="font-bold hover:underline duration-200 cursor-pointer" target="_blank">youtube channel</a>.</br></br>
        And... I lived in Japan for eight years and I can speak the language fairly well.  I have also traveled to Australia, Hong Kong and Korea.  Traveling is something I like to talk about, but really I like to talk about anything, from politics to cooking or anything in between.  I like to let my students come up with the topics they want to talk about.</br></br>
        My hobbies are Japanese Language, internal martial arts, film production (writing acting, editing and directing) stage combat and basic stunt work, basketball and gymnastics.
